Contextualization: Studies point to several shortcomings presented by recently 
graduated software engineering professionals working in industry. 
The teaching approach usually applied in software engineering education is based on extensive content presentation and a practical project that hardly reflects actual existing industry projects. The approach of incorporating open source projects in software engineering education has been presented as an option to let them work with more realistic environments, especially when coo- peration with industry is not feasible. Unlike proprietary software, real-world code and development environments are accessible through the Internet. Students can study their code, generate contributions and interact with the community of users and developers of the project.

Goals: The purpose of this research was to investigate how open source projects have been incorporated into formal education in software engineering and the effectiveness of this approach. Such effectiveness was measured against the achievement of a subset of learning objectives, the support to fill the gap of a subset of deficiencies pointed out by the industry, and the contribution to the student’s preparation for the marketplace by providing a real world experience.

Methodology: To identify how the approach of using open source projects for software engineering learning, we performed a systematic mapping study of the literature. Thus, throughout a systematic process, we selected and classified 72 papers. Before analyzing the approach effectiveness, we established a set of learning objectives that could be practiced by using open source projects. This set was based on the points of view of academia, industry, related work and our own reflection. Next, we studied the adoption of open source projects in three separate case studies for learning (a) software evolution and maintenance, (b) software testing, and (c) software requirements. To judge the feasibility of accomplishing the learning objectives, we defined some heuristics based on the analysis of four dimensions. They were: 
(i) students’ perception on their learning of each investigated learning objective, pre- and post-intervention; 
(ii) analysis of students’ artifacts; 
(iii) students’ perception of their open source project’s activities that contributed to learning each investigated learning objective and 
(iv) learning reported by interviewed students. 
To gather results different from our own experiences, we also performed a synthesis of evidence from related studies. 
From 72 papers retrieved by the systematic mapping study, 18 papers met the criteria defined for the synthesis. At the end of our work, we triangulated all the findings, highlighting the intersections and particularities of each case, and discussed them in the light of our research goals and the existing literature.

Contributions: The main contributions of this research were: 
(i) a general and comprehensive overview of how open source projects have been applied to teach and learn software engineering; 
(ii) identification of software engineering learning objectives from correlating the viewpoints of academia and industry; 
(iii) identification of particular software engineering learning objectives that have been targeted by the use of open source projects and that are favored by such use, according to the literature; 
(iv) synthesis of the evidence from the literature regarding the adoption of open source projects in software engineering education; 
(v) Evidence on the use of open source projects for learning evolution and maintenance of software, software testing and software requirements; 
(vi) analysis of the feasibility of a subset of learning objectives with the adoption of open source projects in software engineering education; 
(vii) a view on the possible consequences of open source projects in students’ learning in software engineering education, and, last, 
(viii) analysis of support for the adoption of open source projects in software engineering education to fill the gaps in training of newly graduated students as pointed out by the industry.

Conclusion: The results found are mostly positive in terms of the investigated effectiveness. On the other hand, the adoption of open source projects also imposes difficulties that need to be overcome. Due to the variables involved in education research and the qualitative approach employed in this study, results may not be generalized to other contexts. Nonetheless, they serve to guide future research and, especially, provide evidence for educators to decide whether to adopt the approach. Regarding the adoption of open source projects in formal education in software engineering, we concluded that it is a feasible and appropriate solution as a scenario of real software project to involve students.
